This is outcome of an introductory course comparing Java and Python programming languages, from the IT Factory platform.
The main scope of the lessons was to go through all the basics of the two languages in order to gain an insight of the similarities and differences between them. 
By passing the course I got to understand and practice my way to making a decision regarding the path I was going to take.
As it can be seen from the Python repositories that I created and that I am going to create on my profile, I decided to continue my professional development by delving into this programming language.
For now at least. :)
